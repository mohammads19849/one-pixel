## How It Works




1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hyperparticle/one-pixel-attack-keras
cd ./one-pixel-attack-keras
```

2. Install the python packages in requirements.txt if you don't have them already.

```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

3. Run the iPython tutorial notebook with Jupyter.

```bash
jupyter notebook ./one-pixel-attack.ipynb
```
